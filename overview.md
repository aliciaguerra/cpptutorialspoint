C++ is a statically typed, compiled, general-purpose, case-sensitive, free-form programming lnaguage that supports
procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming.

C++ is regarded as a middle-level programming language, as it comprises a combination of both high-level
and low-level language features. 

C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup starting in 1979 at Bell Labs in Murray Hill, New Jersey, as an enhancement
to the C programming language and originally named C with classes but it was renamed C++ in 1983.

C++ is a superset of C, and that virtually any legal C program is a legal C++ program.

Note: A programming language is said to use static typing when type checking is performed 
during compile-time as opposed to run-time.

#Object-Oriented Programming
C++ fully supports object-oriented programming, including the four pillars of object-oriented 
development:

- Encapsulation
- Data Hiding
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

#Standard Libraries
Standard C++ consists of three important parts:

- The core language giving all the building blocks including variables, data types, and literals
- The C++ Standard Library giving a rich set of functions manipulating files, strings, etc
- The Standard Template Library (STL) giving a rich set of methods manipulating data structures, etc

#The ANSI Standard
The ANSI standard is an attempt to ensure that C++ is portable -- that code you write for Microsoft's
compiler will compile without errors, using a compiler on a Mac, UNIX, a Windows box, or an Alpha.

The ANSI standard has been stable for a while, and all the major C++ compiler manufacturers support
the ANSI standard.

#Learning C++
The most important thing to do when learning C++ is to focus on concepts and not get lost in the
language technical details.

#Use of C++ 
C++ is used by hundreds of thousands of programmers in essentially every application domain.

C++ is being highly used to write device drivers and other softwares that rely on direct
manipulation of hardware under realtime constraints.

Anyone who has used either an Apple Macintosh or a PC running Windows has indirectly used
C++ because the primary user interfaces of these systems are written in C++.
