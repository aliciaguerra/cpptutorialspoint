A variable provides us with named storage that our programs can manipulate. Each variable
in C++ has a specific type, which determines the size and layout of the variable's memory;
the range of values that can be stored within that memory; and the set of operations that cen be applied
to the variable.

The name of a variable can be composed of letters, digits, and the underscore character. It must begin 
with either a letter or an underscore. Upper and lowercase letters are distinct because C++
is case-sensitive.

bool    Stores either value true or false.
char    Typically a single octet (byte). This is the integer type.
int     The most natural size of the integer for the machine.
float   A single-precision floating point value.
double  A double-precision floating point value
void    Represents the absence of type
wchar_t A wide character type.

C++ also allows to define various other types of variables, which we will cover in subsequent chapters like
Enumerations, Pointer, Array, Reference, Data Structures, and Classes.
